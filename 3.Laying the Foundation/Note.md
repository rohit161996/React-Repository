# Episode 3 Laying the foundation

1. Creating a script to start our project in Dev Mode.
"scripts" : {
    "start" : "parcel index.html",
}

## Command to run the script
- npm run start
- npm start

2. Creating a script to start our project in Production Mode.
"scripts" : {
    "build" : "parcel build index.html",
}

## Command to run the script
- npm run build
- npm build

We can see the package.json to see the scripts to run the new project.


## Need of JSX
- To avoid creating the element like the one given below, JSX is used.

const heading = React.createElement(
    "h1", 
    { id: "heading" }, 
    "Namaste ReactüòÅ");

## Difference b/w React and JSX
- React can be written without JSX, but JSX makes React code writing easier.
- JSX is not a part of React.

## Need of JSX
JSX is a convension where we merge the Javascript and the HTML.
JSX is not HTML inside Java Script, JSX is an HTML like or XML like syntax.
JSX makes it easier to develop the code.

- This is not pure Java Script because it is not ES6. 
const jsxHeading = <h1 id="heading">Namaste React using JSX üòç</h1>;

- JS Engine understands ES6 or ECMAScript.
- But it runs due to parser doing all the things.

- JSX code is transpiled before it reahes the JS Engine.

- Parcel tells Babel to do the Job of transpiling.

(JSX) -----> Babel -----> (JS)

https://babeljs.io/

## Difference between the HTML and JSX
- In JSX there is no class it is "className".
- There is no 'single quotes'.
- Attributes are written in the camelCase.
- For multiline JSX we have to wrap it in the ();
  e.g. const jsxHeading = (<h1 id="heading">
        Namaste React using JSX üòç
        </h1>);


## Components in React
There are two types of components in React:
1. Class Based Components. (Not Used)
2. Functional Components. (New Way of Writing Code)


## Functional Components
- It is a function in Java Script which is returning the JSX Component 
  is a functional component.

const headingComponent = () => {
    return <h1>This is a functional Component</h1>;
}

const headingComponent = () => <h1>This is a functional Component</h1>;

Both the above syntax are correct But use {} in the multiline components.

- Writing return is optional.

const headingComponent = () => {
    return 
    <div>
        <h1>This is a functional Component</h1>;
    </div>
}

const ReactElement = ();
const ReactFunctionalComponent = ()=>{ return};
const ReactFunctionalComponent = ()=> ();

- To render the Functional Component into the Page
root.render(<reactFunctionalComponent/>);

- To get a component somewhere in the code we can use
<reactFunctionalComponent/> anywhere in the code to render.
It can be used inside a components as well.


## Component Composition
Writing the Component inside the Component is called Component Composition.

- We can write function also instead of the Arrow Function, but it is necessary to return it.
const HeadingComponent = function() => {
    return (
        <div id="container">
            <Title/>    
            <h1>This is a functional Component</h1>
        </div>
    );
}

## Super power of JSX 
- We can write any expression of Java Script in the {}.
- We can write a react element inside a react element as well.

## Cross Site Scripting
- If somebody wants to run a java script to someone's code it is called cross site scripting.
- It steels cookies, sessions.
So, the {element} will not directly run the code it will sanitize the data. It protects cross site scripting.

## NOTE:
- The functional component can also be written like:
<Title/> or <Title></Title>

- We can also call a function inside a JSX.
{Title()}


## Why code is readable?
Due to JSX.

## Why Code is Faster?
Due to the Bundle.
