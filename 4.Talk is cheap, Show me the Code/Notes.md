## Standard Component Format

const AppLayout = () => {
    return (`<div></div>`);
}

## Ways to give css to a component
1. In the index.css like the external css.

2. In the inline JSX tag as a javascript object.
<div className="res-card" style={{backgroundColor: "red"}}>


3. In the program by making a React Element.
const styleCard = {
   backgroundColor: "red"
}
const RestaurantCard = () =>{
    return(
        `<div className="res-card" style={styleCard}><h3>Meghna Foods</h3></div>`
    )
}

## How can we create the dynamic Cards?
By using the props.

## Props in React 
- Passing a prop to a component is like passing the argument to a function.
- These are just the attributes which are passed to the components.

E.g.
<RestaurantCard 
resname = "McDonald's"
cuisine = "American"
/>

const RestaurantCard = (props) =>{
   // Now props can be accessed here using the . operator
   {props.resname}
   {props.cuisine}
}

- These all properties are wrapped inside the javascript object and these 
  are sent to the function arguments using the props keyword.

- Use the props in the Functional Components like a javascript object.

- Destructuring on the fly
<RestaurantCard 
resname = "McDonald's"
cuisine = "American"
/>

const RestaurantCard = ({resname, cuisine}) =>{
   // Now props can be accessed here using the . operator
   {resname}
   {cuisine}
}

- To understand the things properly :-

const RestaurantCard = (props) =>{
   const {resname, cuisine} = props;

   // Now props can be accessed here using the . operator
   {resname}
   {cuisine}
}

- How the data comes to us from the backend?
0. It will come in the form of a JSON file.
1. Install the plugin to see the data coming from the backend .
2. Inspect Element -> Network Tab -> Fetch/XHR -> Reload -> Click links and find api's -> Open in New Tab
3. Copy the data to the program.


## Config Driven UI
- Some offers are available in some location and some other in some other location.
- The UI is driven by the config which is the JSON data from the backend.
- The config means the JSON data.

```json
{
  "statusCode": 0,
  "data": {
    "statusMessage": "done successfully",
    "pageOffset": {
      "nextOffset": "CJhlELQ4KIDQwPHy2OelazCnEzgD",
      "widgetOffset": {
        "NewListingView_category_bar_chicletranking_TwoRows": "",
        "NewListingView_category_bar_chicletranking_TwoRows_Rendition": "",
        "Restaurant_Group_WebView_SEO_PB_Theme": "",
        "collectionV5RestaurantListWidget_SimRestoRelevance_food_seo": "9",
        "inlineFacetFilter": "",
        "restaurantCountWidget": ""
      }
    },
    "cards": [],
    "firstOffsetRequest": true,
    "cacheExpiryTime": 240,
    "nextFetch": 1
  },
  "tid": "f7bf6d4f-7316-4926-8371-16650cc70ba2",
  "sid": "ktue50a6-805a-41a0-a1ef-2f4be0648df8",
  "deviceId": "4afd8a8e-1cb4-15bb-65eb-d5317ddd58d3",
  "csrfToken": "1ZKvnAV2wCP5-pjCLmGuAq_q_FK4scVMAjzFtJWQ"
}
```

- Send the data which is required by the UI from the backend and consume it to build the UI on the front end.

- UI is powered by the data.

## How to integrate data manually to the front end?
- Take the data as an object in the code like const data = {}.
- Pass the data as a prop to the functional component <Component resData={data}/>.
- Take the data into the function as props like
   const Component => (resData){ <br>
      const {resObj} = resData; <br>
   }

## CDN to store images
Swiggy uses the CDN to store the images. So, the image source is link+"id".

## To make our code look good
- We will use Optional Chaining.
- const { cloudinaryImageId, name, avgRating, cuisines, areaName, costForTwo } = resData?.info;

## How to loop over the components in React?
We will loop over the components in React by using map or for-each loop, but we will be using map.

## MAP, FILTER and REDUCE are very important.

## Importance of Key in the map while looping.
- React will re render all the components when one component is added, because it will be confused where to insert the component.
- In react version 19 it will throw an error.

## Alternative to the key
- We can also write the index instead of key, but the React's official website says do not use index for keys as the order of items may change.

" Index as a key is an anti-pattern"

## If we do not have a key by any means then we have no other option than to use the id.

## [Not using keys] <<<<<<<<< [Index as a key] <<<<<<<<< [Unique Id]
